# Forest Fire Risk Prediction via Satellite Imagery and Weather Data

This project analyzes whether a given location is forested using satellite images and then predicts monthly fire risk levels based on 10 years of weather data.

## Features
- Google Maps Static API integration
- Image processing with OpenCV to detect forested areas
- Open-Meteo Historical API integration
- Fire risk score calculation based on temperature, wind speed, and precipitation
- Visualized monthly fire risk trends over 10 years

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Google Maps Static API
- Open-Meteo API
